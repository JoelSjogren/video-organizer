## TODO ##
The things listed here are by no means things I plan to do. They're a collection of ideas: a collection that will help me whenever I don't know what to do next. Therefore, feel free to add suggestions.
 - switch to using boost for all file operations since we use it for some
 - write a gui
 - build for windows
 - build for mac
 - build for both 64-bit and 32-bit
 - colorize console output
 - add option to move directories when cleaning instead of removing them
 - bug: -c does not copy files. it outputs 4K files instead.
 - write test for contents of copied files
 - write an exception printer in Console. it should exit(1) the program.
 - integrate exit(1) into Console::f()
 - add --overwrite option
