## TODO ##
The things listed here are by no means things I plan to do. They're a collection of ideas: a collection that will help me whenever I don't know what to do next. Therefore, feel free to add suggestions.
 - switch to using boost for all file operations since we use it for some
 - write a gui
 - build for windows
 - build for mac
 - build for both 64-bit and 32-bit
 - colorize console output
