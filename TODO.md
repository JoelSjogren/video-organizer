## TODO ##
The things listed here are by no means things I plan to do. They're a collection of ideas: a collection that will help me whenever I don't know what to do next. Therefore, feel free to add suggestions.
 - switch to using boost for all file operations since we use it for some
 - write a gui
 - shallow sort, i.e. don't create directories. instead, just output to *outdir*
 - naming convention: community.s01e01.pilot.dvdrip.xvid-clerks.avi -> Community (uppercase 'C')
 - title recognition: manual (how? argument may be inappropriate for multiple files)
 - improve algorithm for detecting worthless directories: use tree instead of list
 - build for windows
 - build for mac
 - build for both 64-bit and 32-bit
 - colorize console output
 - write test for --shallow-output
