## TODO ##
The things listed here are by no means things I plan to do. They're a collection of ideas: a collection that will help me whenever I don't know what to do next. Therefore, feel free to add suggestions.
 - switch to using boost for all file operations since we use it for some
 - write a gui
 - fix minor bug when combining --simulate and --clean: no record is kept about which files are removed; hence clean sees files that it shouldn't
 - shallow sort, i.e. don't create directories
 - move as much file operations as possible into FileMan to improve extensibility
