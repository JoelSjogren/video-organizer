## TODO ##
The things listed here are by no means things I plan to do. They're a collection of ideas: a collection that will help me whenever I don't know what to do next. Therefore, feel free to add suggestions.
 - --Add support for *filelist* in addic7ed-cli--. While you're at it, also add a fix to rename subtitles ["Show.S01E02.avi.part" -> "Show.S01E02.srt"] instead of ["Show.S01E02.avi.part" -> "Show.S01E02.avi.srt"]
