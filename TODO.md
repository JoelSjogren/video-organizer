## TODO ##
The things listed here are by no means things I plan to do. They're a collection of ideas: a collection that will help me whenever I don't know what to do next. Therefore, feel free to add suggestions.
 - switch to using boost for all file operations since we use it for some
 - build for both 64-bit and 32-bit
 - add option to move directories when cleaning instead of removing them
 - write an exception printer in Console. it should exit(1) the program.
 - add --overwrite option
 - add support for sherlock.3x02.the_sign_of_three.hdtv_x264-fov.mp4. this will be a tricky one since the capitalization is wrong. it may be the case that the user will have to use --manual-name. however with that approach, it will probably happen that the user accidentally sorts without --manual-name first. (that would have happened in my case had vorg succeded.) therefore we will need a **-merge** option to merge title folders: "sherlock" + "Sherlock" -> the latter.
