## TODO ##
The things listed here are by no means things I plan to do. They're a collection of ideas: a collection that will help me whenever I don't know what to do next. Therefore, feel free to add suggestions.
 - cleanup script for almost-empty directories
 - switch to using boost for all file operations since we use it for some
 - document non-standard headers briefly
