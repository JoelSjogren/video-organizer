## TODO ##
The things listed here are by no means things I plan to do. They're a collection of ideas: a collection that will help me whenever I don't know what to do next. Therefore, feel free to add suggestions.
 - Add gtk/qt interface?
 - cleanup script for almost-empty directories
 - add tests for static functions in Parser
 - add option to manually specify output file naming, e.g.
 
    vorg infile.avi -o OutFile.avi -m
