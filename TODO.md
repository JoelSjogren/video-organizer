## TODO ##
The things listed here are by no means things I plan to do. They're a collection of ideas: a collection that will help me whenever I don't know what to do next. Therefore, feel free to add suggestions.
 - switch to using boost for all file operations since we use it for some
 - build for both 64-bit and 32-bit
 - add option to move directories when cleaning instead of removing them
 - write an exception printer in Console. it should exit(1) the program.
 - add --overwrite option
